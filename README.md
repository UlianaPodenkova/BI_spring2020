# This repository contains workflow for project "Search for genes associated with invasiveness in different genetic lines of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*"
## The goal of the project is to analyze the features of virulence mechanisms for specific genetic lines, based on a comparison of highly virulent and low virulent strains in several datasets, each of which is represented by a single sequence type according to MLST.
